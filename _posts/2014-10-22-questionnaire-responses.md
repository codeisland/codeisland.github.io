October 22, 2014, Providence, RI—Code Island, Rhode Island’s Code for America brigade, released the responses to their open data questionnaire from all three major candidates vying to be mayor of Providence. The responses define each candidate's position in five specific areas related to open data and open government. 

“The first and most important take-away is that all three candidates replied,” said Ryan Kelly, one of Code Island’s co-captains. “This shows that open data—a primary enabler of transparency and constituent services—has fully penetrated the political discussion. If you're running for office, you have to be aware of these issues.” 

According to Code Island’s Community Organizer Shawn Selleck, who is also a civic innovation consultant to the city of Providence, Code Island chose to limit the questionnaire to Providence mayoral candidates because the city lags behind its peers in access to open data.

“Despite recent progress, we're still way behind the curve,” Selleck said. “In designing the questionnaire, we surveyed IT spending in comparable and neighboring cities, and we spend half or less than others. This is as a percentage of the budget, not as a dollar amount.”

Code Island has posted the responses online. The organization will provide some analysis to help the public better understand the differences among the candidates, but the organization will not endorse any particular candidate.

“All three candidates support open data,” added David Johnson, Code Island’s other co-captain, “but in different ways and for different reasons. For example, they all agree that the IT budget in Providence is too low, but only Dr. Harrop specifies a target spending level.”
