Not too much report, per se, but the budget visualization sankey chart is looking great. Now we just need to make the RI data work with this tool. 

And Thom Guertin confirmed that a [Google Trekker](https://www.google.com/maps/about/partners/streetview/trekker/) will be available to Code Island sometime in 2015. When we have a firm date, we'll reach out to ask Rhode Islanders what they want to see trekked.

What else...? I found these cool new links

[Code for America Brigade Tools](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/tools) How-tos and such. 

[US City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/) Code Island is now custodian of the Providence listing, and we have updated it. We jumped about 10 spots from the mid-40s to the mid-30s. There's still a long way to go, but we're making progress.

And then we got to work on projects...
